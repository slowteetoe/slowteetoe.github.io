This is the first post on my new blog, powered by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).  What about [dequeue.blogspot.com](http://dequeue.blogspot.com)? I finally got tired of dealing with HTML, especially since the majority of my posts deal with code.  It's so much nicer to write content and just use some backticks than attempt to wrangle &lt;pre&gt; tags, plus... syntax highlighting!

Will I backport the old content? I don't know yet; I just copied over the last post and converted it by hand, but it took a while to do.  There are a couple tools out there to help transition content from Blogger to markdown but I'm not sure there will be anything that makes it easy.
