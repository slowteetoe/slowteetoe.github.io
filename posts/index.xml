What about dequeue.blogspot.com? I finally got tired of dealing with HTML, especially since the majority of my posts deal with code. It&amp;rsquo;s so much nicer to write content and just use some backticks than attempt to wrangle &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tags, plus&amp;hellip; syntax highlighting!
Will I backport the old content? I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet; I just copied over the last post and converted it by hand, but it took a while to do.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading My Kubernetes Cluster</title><link>https://slowteetoe.github.io/posts/upgrade-kube/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 19:35:18 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://slowteetoe.github.io/posts/upgrade-kube/</guid><description>Rough guide to upgrading k8s cluster with kubeadm Disclaimer: This is not the best way, just a way that works for me given the cluster topography I have (which was installed using kubeadm on ubuntu, and includes a non-HA etcd running in-cluster).
On the control plane / master node Backup etcd (manually) You might need the info from the etcd pod (kubectl -n kube-system describe po etcd-master) to find the various certs/keys/etc, but they&amp;rsquo;re probably at /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/</description></item></channel></rss>
